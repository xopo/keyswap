# Swap keys
Swap right cmd -> ctrl for apple keyboard - usefull for some programs
## The why
When you use keyboard shortcuts cmd can only do so much. For some cases ctr has it's use and the way apple keyboard layout is done doesn't help. Having Ctrl placed more ergonomic does wonders.
## But why?
There is Karabiner-elements which is a complete program that does that for you. 
True, but you need to add 2 more background programs with extra permissions to run with root permission and monitoring capacities. In some environments that is not possible. 
This solution is clean and doesn't require special permissions. If other changes are required they can be added in future.
